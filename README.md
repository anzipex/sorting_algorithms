### Sorting Algorithms

This program implements various sorting algorithms, including:

    Insertion
    Selection
    Bubble
    Shell
    Merge
    Heap
    Quick
    Quick 3-Way

The program can generate a vector of floating-point numbers either manually or randomly. `cpu_time` timestamps are recorded for performance analysis and sorting results are printed to the console.

### Running the Program:
You must specify the number of elements and their values via command-line arguments to fill the vector.

### Filling the Vector:
* **Manual Input**: Provide numbers as arguments:
```bash
./main 0.3 0.2 0.9 0.4 0.7 0.5 0.1 0.6 0.8 1.0
```
* **Random Input**: Provide a single argument for the number of random elements:
```bash
./main 10 
```

### Notes:
The program not prints the sorted arrays for each sorting algorithm.
The program prints sorted array at the end.
