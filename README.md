### Sorting Algorithms

This program implements various sorting algorithms, including:

    Insertion Sort
    Selection Sort
    Bubble Sort
    Shell Sort
    Merge Sort
    Heap Sort
    Quick Sort
    Quick Sort 3-Way

The program can generate a vector of floating-point numbers either manually or randomly. Sorting results are printed to the console, and `cpu_time` timestamps are recorded for performance analysis.

### Running the Program:
You can specify the number of elements and their values via command-line arguments.

### Filling the Vector:
* Manual Input: Provide numbers as arguments:
```bash
./main 0.3 0.2 0.9 0.4 0.7 0.5 0.1 0.6 0.8 1.0
```
* Random Input: Provide a single argument for the number of random elements:
```bash
./main 10 
```

### Notes:
The program prints source unsorted array.
The program not prints the sorted arrays for each sorting algorithm.
